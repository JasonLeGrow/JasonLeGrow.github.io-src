I am a PhD student in the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization][co] and the [Institute for Quantum Computing][iqc] at the [University of Waterloo][uw]. I am supervised by David Jao and Michele Mosca.

My main research interests are cryptography and quantum information; particularly post-quantum cryptography and quantum cryptanalysis. My current work focuses on improving implementations of [CSIDH][csidh] by finding better parameter sets and faster algorithms for evaluating the class group action, and increasing its resilience against fault attacks.

Recreationally, I am interested in machine learning, data science, data visualization, and combinatorial design theory.
