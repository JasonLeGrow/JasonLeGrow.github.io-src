I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Mathematics][vtmath] at [Virginia Tech][vt]. I am also affilated with [VTQ][vtq]: the Virginia Tech Center for Quantum Information Science and Engineering.

My main research interests are cryptography and quantum information; particularly post-quantum cryptography and quantum cryptanalysis. My current work includes: 

- Developing new cryptographic protocols with advanced functionalities from group actions, including [CSIDH][csidh], [LESS][less], and [MEDS][meds];
- Finding better parameter sets and faster algorithms for evaluating the class group action in CSIDH; 
- Studying fault attacks on post-quantum protocols and in the quantum setting; and,
- Understanding properties of isogeny graphs and their implications for isogeny-based cryptography.

In the past, I have worked on topics in coding theory, developing algorithms for evaluating isogenies of smooth degree in the context of SIDH and eSIDH, protocols built from SIDH, classical and quantum cryptanalysis, and configuration orderings of block designs.

From September 2020 to June 2022 I was a research fellow in the [Department of Mathematics][math] at the [University of Auckland][uauckland], supervised by Steven Galbraith. I completed my PhD in the [Department of Combinatorics and Optimization][co] and the [Institute for Quantum Computing][iqc] at the [University of Waterloo][uw] under the supervision of David Jao and Michele Mosca.

<!-- Recreationally, I am interested in machine learning, data science, data visualization, and combinatorial design theory. -->
