I like to create interactive visualizations, particularly for geospatial data. This page has some of the visualizations that I've made that I'm most happy with.

My tool of choice for creating visualizations is [Python][python]; for wrangling data I use [Pandas][pd] and [GeoPandas][gpd], and for the interactive elements I like [Bokeh][bk]. 

  [python]: https://www.python.org/
  [pd]: https://pandas.pydata.org/
  [gpd]: https://geopandas.org/
  [bk]: https://bokeh.org/
